# Introduction 

## About myself

My name is Kamarul Imran, but just call me KIM. 

I hold the position of Associate Professor in Epidemiology and Statistics at the School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia. Currently, 

- Head, Department of Community Medicine, School of Medical Sciences, 
- Adjunct Assoc Prof at School of Medical and Life Sciences, Sunway University. 
- Treasurer, Malaysian Association of Epidemiology 

My academic profile is available [here](http://www.medic.usm.my/jpm/index.php/en/academic-information/587-prof-madya-dr-kamarul-imran-musa)

Previously, I also taught at Monash Universiti Malaysia for the business analytics course, a Master programme.

### Research interests

My research interests include medical epidemiology, statistical modelling and machine learning. 

Recently, I was awarded with the FRGS grant (RM125,000) to understand the roles of  mammography images and clinical conditions on the performance of machine learning and statistical models to predict breast cancer.

## Introduction to workshop

Length of workshop : 180 minutes

Approaches:

- Theory
- Practical 
- Tips

# Data analysis workflow (40 minutes)

Based on my experience

- Read : Read data into R 
- Explore : Explore data using graphs and tables
- Assume : Identify assumptions for the analysis
- Analyze : Analyze data based on objectives and proposed methods
- Assess : Assess results based on assumptions. Identify limitations of analysis
- Present : Present results, data and codes

# Data visualization

Data visualization is defined as

… the graphical representation of information and data. 

How to perform? We will use visual elements

- charts, 
- graphs, and 
- maps

Data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.

Objective of data visualization: 
data visualization tools and technologies are used to analyze massive amounts of information and make data-driven decisions.


Figures : 
- A figures is a visual presentation of results. Come in the form of graphs, charts, drawings, photos, or maps.  They provide visual impact and can effectively communicate your primary finding.

Plot: 
- A plot is a graphical technique for representing a data set Usually as a graph showing the relationship between two or more variables. The plot can be drawn by hand or by a computer.

Graphs: 
- A graph is a picture designed to express words Particularly the connection between two or more quantities.

# Data wrangling

Remember: 

Data – variables in tabular format

Variables - In columns
Observations - In rows 

Definition : Data are characteristics or information
usually numerical that are collected through observation.

Data is a set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables They are about one or more persons or objects, while a datum (singular of data) is single value of a single variable.

Definition : variable is any characteristics, number, or quantity that can be measured or counted.

Types of variables: 

- Numeric  
- Categorical

Categorical variables

- have values that describe a 'quality' or 'characteristic' of a data unit 
- Categorical variables may be further described as ordinal or nominal
- An ordinal variable = a value that can be logically ordered or ranked. 

- Size : small, medium, large, extra large
- Attitudes : strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree

A nominal variable has no logical sequence. 

- Sex : male, female
- Business type : insurance, healthcare, retail
- Race : Asian, Caucasian, African

## Tips

# Statistical modelling: Scalar or continuous outcome (20 minutes)

Objectives of lecture:

At the end of the lecture, students will be 
- Able to model continuous outcome variable using multiple linear regression
- Able to  perform model assessment 
- Able to interpret model

We analyze data 
- to explain relationship between variables 
- to estimate the effect of a set of variables (predictors) onto another variable (the outcome)
- to make inference – how large the effect?
- to predict the outcome based on new data

Estimation and Inference

To estimate: A process by which one makes inferences about a population, based on information obtained from a sample.
To infer : To make reasons involved in drawing a conclusion or making a logical judgment on the basis of circumstantial evidence and prior conclusions and not only on the basis of direct observation

## Hands-on Linear regression model

```{r, child=here::here('4_linear_logistic','Short_LR_Practicals.Rmd')}

```


# Statistical modelling: Binary outcome (20 minutes)


Motivation 

When outcome is binary, the common analysis for making inference or prediction is logistic regression. 


What are the aims?

- To explain vs to predict
- In statistics, to explain is more common: Interested in the beta
- In analytics, to predict is more common: Not interested in beta, but interested to predict the outcome

Questions:

- Give example of outcome relevant to your area that you may study
- State the objective of the analysis
- Are the data suitable for logistic regression analysis?

When the outcome is categorical (in the form of binary), we model using logistic regression. Examples of binary outcome

- Acceptance of loan = Accepted vs Rejected
- Loan defaulters = Yes vs No

Binary logistic regression modesl, for example :
- Acceptance of loan  <- gender  + age  + job status + ….
- Loan defaulters  <-  age + income + amount of loan + …..
