## Research interests

My research interests include medical epidemiology, statistical modelling and machine learning. 

Recently, I was awarded with the FRGS grant (RM125,000) to understand the roles of  mammography images and clinical conditions on the performance of machine learning and statistical models to predict breast cancer.

## Introduction

Length of workshop : 180 minutes

Approaches:

- Theory
- Practical 
- Tips

## Data analysis workflow (40 minutes)

Powerpoint presentation 

- Read : Read data into R 
- Explore : Explore data using graphs and tables
- Assume : Identify assumptions for the analysis
- Analyze : Analyze data based on objectives and proposed methods
- Assess : Assess results based on assumptions. Identify limitations of analysis
- Present : Present results, data and codes 


### Data visualization

Data visualization is 

… the graphical representation of information and data. 

This is done using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps
Data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.

Objective: data visualization tools and technologies are used to analyze massive amounts of information and make data-driven decisions.


Visualization, Figures, Plots, Graphs  
Data visualization : 
graphical representation of information and data
Figures : 
A figures is a visual presentation of results. 
Come in the form of graphs, charts, drawings, photos, or maps.  
They provide visual impact and can effectively communicate your primary finding.
Plot: 
A plot is a graphical technique for representing a data set
Usually as a graph showing the relationship between two or more variables.
The plot can be drawn by hand or by a computer.
Graphs: 
A graph is a picture designed to express words
Particularly the connection between two or more quantities. 




### Data wrangling

Remember 
Data – variables in tabular format
Variables 
In columns
Observations
In rows 

Definition : data 
Data are characteristics or information
usually numerical
that are collected through observation.[1]

Data is a set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables
They are about one or more persons or objects, while a datum (singular of data) is single value of a single variable.[2]

Definition : variables 
A variable is any characteristics, number, or quantity that can be measured or counted.
Types of variables: Numeric  

Types of variables : Categorical
Categorical variables = have values that describe a 'quality' or 'characteristic' of a data unit
'what type' or 'which category‘
Categorical variables may be further described as ordinal or nominal:
An ordinal variable = a value that can be logically ordered or ranked. 
Size = small, medium, large, extra large
Attitudes = strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree
A nominal variable = NO logical sequence. 
Sex = male, female
Business type = insurance, healthcare, retail
Race = Asian, Caucasian, African



### Tips



## Statistical modelling (40 minutes)

### Scalar

Objectives of lecture
At the end of the lecture, students will be 
Able to model continuous outcome variable using multiple linear regression
Able to  perform model assessment 
Able to interpret model
Introduction 
We analyze data 
To explain relationship between variables 
To estimate the effect of a set of variables (predictors) onto another variable (the outcome)
To make inference – how large the effect?
To predict the outcome based on new data
Estimation and Inference
To estimate = 
A process by which one makes inferences about a population, based on information obtained from a sample.
Making inference = 
the reasoning involved in drawing a conclusion or making a logical judgment
on the basis of circumstantial evidence and prior conclusions 
Not only on the basis of direct observation


### Binary


Motivation 
When outcome is binary, the common analysis for making inference or prediction is logistic regression
Inference = explanation 
What is the aim?
To explain vs to predict
In statistics, to explain is more common
Interested in the beta
In analytics, to predict is more common
Not interested in beta, but interested to predict the outcome
Questions 
Give example of outcome relevant to your area that you may study
State the objective of the analysis
Are the data suitable for logistic regression analysis?

Outcome variable
When the outcome is categorical (in the form of binary), we model using logistic regression  
Binary outcome
Acceptance of loan = Accepted vs Rejected
Loan defaulters = Yes vs No
For example :
Acceptance of loan  <- gender  + age  + job status + ….
Loan defaulters  <-  age + income + amount of loan + …..
