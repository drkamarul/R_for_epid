# Data analysis workflow (40 minutes)

Based on my experience, this workflow will help you be effective

- Read : Read data into R 
- Explore : Explore data using graphs and tables
- Assume : Identify assumptions for the analysis
- Analyze : Analyze data based on objectives and proposed methods
- Assess : Assess results based on assumptions. Identify limitations of analysis
- Present : Present results, data and codes 

Below, is another workflow, proposed by Hadley in his book.

# Data visualization

## Introduction

Data visualization is defined as **the graphical representation of information and data.** 

How to perform data visualization? We will be using visual elements such as:

- charts 
- graphs
- maps

Data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.

Objective of data visualization: 
data visualization tools and technologies are used to analyze massive amounts of information and make data-driven decisions.


Figures : 

- A figures is a visual presentation of results. Come in the form of graphs, charts, drawings, photos, or maps.  They provide visual impact and can effectively communicate your primary finding.

Plot: 

- A plot is a graphical technique for representing a data set Usually as a graph showing the relationship between two or more variables. The plot can be drawn by hand or by a computer.

Graphs: 

- A graph is a picture designed to express words Particularly the connection between two or more quantities.

## Questions and Tips

- Do you know the location of your folder?
- How Posit cloud differ from RStudio IDE on your machine?
- What is an R project?
- What is an R package? How many R packages are there? What are packages useful to generate plots and graphs?
- What is an R code?
- What is a function?


# Data wrangling

## Introduction

Remember, dataset contains data. Data contains variables in tabular format. There are: 

- Variables in columns
- Observations in rows 

Definition : Data are characteristics or information usually numerical that are collected through observation.Data is a set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables They are about one or more persons or objects, while a datum (singular of data) is single value of a single variable.

Definition : variable is any characteristics, number, or quantity that can be measured or counted.

Types of variables: 

- Numeric  
- Categorical

Categorical variables 

- have values that describe a 'quality' or 'characteristic' of a data unit 
- may be further described as ordinal or nominal
- such as an ordinal variable has values that can be logically ordered or ranked. 

- Size : small, medium, large, extra large
- Attitudes : strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree

A nominal variable has no logical sequence. For example:

- Sex : male, female
- Business type : insurance, healthcare, retail
- Race : Asian, Caucasian, African

## Hands-on

```{r, child=here::here('3_wrangling_EDA','data_transformation_imr2020_note.Rmd')}

```

## Questions and Tips

- Whas is data wrangling?
- Why R store data in RAM?
- What are the common data wrangling processes in your field?
- What are R packages useful to wrangle data?
- If you are given a dataset in MS Excel, should you wrangle in Excel or in RStudio?
- Is data wrangling safe? Will it overwrite the original data?

# Epidemiological analysis

The workflow and codes for this section come largelyt from [The Epidemiologist R Handbook](https://epirhandbook.com/en/epidemic-curves.html)

## Objectives

We will generate an epidemic curve.

## Loading packages

Now, we will use a different function `pacman::p_load()`. This function will load the libraries. If the libraries are not installed, then they will be installed. But you have to be connected to the internet. 

```{r}
pacman::p_load(
  rio,          # file import/export
  here,         # relative filepaths 
  lubridate,    # working with dates/epiweeks
  aweek,        # alternative package for working with dates/epiweeks
  incidence2,   # epicurves of linelist data
  i2extras,     # supplement to incidence2
  stringr,      # search and manipulate character strings
  forcats,      # working with factors
  RColorBrewer, # Color palettes from colorbrewer2.org
  tidyverse     # data management + ggplot2 graphics
) 
```

## Import data

We have a linelisting data. 

```{r}
linelist <- import(here("datasets_wf", "linelist_cleaned.xlsx"))
glimpse(linelist)
```
## Aggregate data by hospitals

```{r}
count_data <- linelist %>% 
  group_by(hospital, date_hospitalisation) %>% 
  summarize(n_cases = n()) %>% 
  filter(date_hospitalisation > as.Date("2013-06-01")) %>% 
  ungroup()
count_data
```

## Set date

We set the date to make sure we all have similar results. In reality, this is not so. 

```{r}
data_date <- as.Date("2015-05-15")
```

## Generate epidemic curve

we will follow 2 steps and use the **incidence2** package:

1. Create an incidence object (using the function incidence())
  - Provide the data
  - Specify the date column to `date_index =`
  - Specify the `interval =` into which the cases should be aggregated (daily, weekly, monthly..)
  - Specify any grouping columns (e.g. gender, hospital, outcome)
  
2. Plot the incidence object
  - Specify labels, colors, titles, etc.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(incidence2)
```

```{r}
# create the incidence object, aggregating cases by day
epi_day <- incidence(     # create incidence object
  x = linelist,             # dataset
  date_index = "date_onset",  # date column
  interval = "day"          # date grouping interval
  )
```

## Incidence format and data

This is the format of the incidence object.

```{r}
class(epi_day)
```
And this is the data that will form the curve

```{r}
epi_day
```
or

```{r}
summary(epi_day)
```
## Plot epidemic curve

```{r}
plot(epi_day)
```


# Statistical modelling: Scalar or continuous outcome (20 minutes)

## Introduction

Objectives:

At the end of this section, you will be to

- model continuous outcome variable using multiple linear regression
- perform model assessment 
- interpret model

Regression analysis helps us 

- to explain relationship between variables 
- to estimate the effect of a set of variables (predictors) onto another variable (the outcome)
- to make inference – how large the effect?
- to predict the outcome based on new data

Estimation and inference are different. 

- To estimate: A process by which one makes inferences about a population, based on information obtained from a sample.
- To infer : To make reasons involved in drawing a conclusion or making a logical judgment on the basis of circumstantial evidence and prior conclusions and not only on the basis of direct observation

## Hands-on 

```{r, child=here::here('4_linear_logistic','Short_LR_Practicals.Rmd')}

```


# Statistical modelling: Binary outcome (20 minutes)

## Motivation 

When outcome is binary, the common analysis for making inference or prediction is logistic regression. 


What are the aims?

- To explain vs to predict
- In statistics, to explain is more common: Interested in the beta
- In analytics, to predict is more common: Not interested in beta, but interested to predict the outcome

Questions:

- Give example of outcome relevant to your area that you may study
- State the objective of the analysis
- Are the data suitable for logistic regression analysis?

When the outcome is categorical (in the form of binary), we model using logistic regression. Examples of binary outcome

- Acceptance of loan = Accepted vs Rejected
- Loan defaulters = Yes vs No

Binary logistic regression models, for example :

- Acceptance of loan  <- gender  + age  + job status + ….
- Loan defaulters  <-  age + income + amount of loan + …..

The logit model is written as:

$$log \frac{p}{1-p} = \beta_0 + \beta_{age} + \beta_{male} + \beta_{chinese} + \beta_{indians} + \beta_{age}\times\beta_{male}$$

## Hands-on  

```{r, child=here::here('4_linear_logistic','Short_Log_regression.Rmd')}

```


# Summary

Useful for users and trainers:

1. Draft your data analysis workflow 
2. Identify each stage of the workflow
3. At each stage, ask
  -   what task is involved
  -   what **R functions** required to perform the task
  -   which **R package that contains the function**
4. Perform the task using the default parameters
5. Tweak the function to suit more complex task
6. If errors committed, get help
  -   friends
  -   StackOverflow
  -   R community
7. Use tools
  -   Posit Cloud
  -   RStudio IDE
  -   Google Collab
8. Traditional stat software may not able to handle the demand of modern-wide-big-on-the-cloud data
9.    Practice, practice, practise
